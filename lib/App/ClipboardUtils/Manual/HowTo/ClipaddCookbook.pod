# ABSTRACT: Cookbook for clipadd

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<clipadd> lets you add items to the clipboard. It is
clipboard-manager-agnostic, supporting backends like B<xclip> and B<Klipper>. It
also has some convenient features which will be demonstrated in this document.


=head1 RECIPES

=head2 Adding ouput from command-line, one line at a time

 % clipadd -c COMMAND
 % clipadd -c COMMAND -t ; # to see the output on stdout as well

This is convenient because it lets you feed input to a command interactively and
immediately get the output as clipboard content.

For example, using with L<safer>:

 % clipadd -c safer -t
 Foo Bar, Inc.
 foo-bar-inc

I can paste company names and get a slug name to use in file manager to create
directory, etc.

=head2 Adding text fragments from a text file as clipboard contents

 % clipadd --fragments < FILENAME

For example, when a customer service officer is replying chats from customers,
she can add a few most frequently asked questions into the clipboard then use
keyboard shortcuts (e.g. C<Ctrl-Alt-Up> and C<Ctrl-Alt-Down> if configured in
Klipper) to quickly access those template replies.

Example content of text file:
