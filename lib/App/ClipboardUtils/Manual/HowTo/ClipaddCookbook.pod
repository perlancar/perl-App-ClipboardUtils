# ABSTRACT: Cookbook for clipadd

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<clipadd> lets you add items to the clipboard. It is
clipboard-manager-agnostic, supporting backends like B<xclip> and B<Klipper>. It
also has some convenient features which will be demonstrated in this document.


=head1 RECIPES

=head2 Adding ouput from command-line, one line at a time

 % clipadd -c COMMAND
 % clipadd -c COMMAND -t ; # to see the output on stdout as well

This is convenient because it lets you feed input to a command interactively and
immediately get the output as clipboard content.

For example, using with L<safer>:

 % clipadd -c safer -t
 Foo Bar, Inc.
 foo-bar-inc

I can paste company names and get a slug name to use in file manager to create
directory, etc.

=head2 Adding entries from a text file

 % clipadd --split-by '\n---\n' < FILENAME

For example, adding FAQ entries from a file with this text file:

 Question 1
 Answer 1
 ---
 Question 2
 Answer 2
 ---
 Question 3
 Answer 3

then you can setup keyboard shortcuts like C<Ctrl-Alt-Up> and C<Ctrl-Alt-Down>
in B<Klipper> to quickly access those FAQ entries to provide quick answers in
chats.

=head2 Adding text fragments from a text file as clipboard contents

 % clipadd --fragments < FILENAME

This is a variation from the previous recipe. Using fragments allows you to only
add certain entries and in custom order. Example content of text file:

 FAQS
 ====

 Question 1
 # BEGIN clipadd id=2
 Answer 1
 # END clipadd id=2

 Question 2
 # BEGIN clipadd id=1
 Answer 2
 # END clipadd id=1

 Question 3
 # BEGIN clipadd id=3
 Answer 3
 # END clipadd id=3

 Question 4
 Answer 4
